## Story

Ricky Rat has always been envious of Mickey's fame. Now he has found a time portal to the past and sees his opportunity.
He goes back in time to steal Steamboat Willie from Mickey. However, the universe senses that something is wrong and sends all kinds of things to correct the timeline,
but primarily the Disney worshippers who want to avenge Mickey Mouse's honour by destroying the boat.

## Tutorial Sequence

We see Mickey steering the boat.  
The protagonist shows up next to him.  
Text shows up:  
"Press A and D to move, W to jump."  
When protagonist reaches Mickey, new text shows up.  
"Press S to grab."  
When protagonist grabs Mickey, new text shows up.  
"Flick the mouse to yeet."  
When the protagonist yeets Mickey off the boat, the game starts.  

## Main gameplay

Various creatures will approach the steering wheel and try to break it.  
The steering wheel has a life meter that goes down when it is attacked.  
You have to grab the creatures and yeet them off the boat.  
If you stay away from the steering wheel for too long, the boat starts to wobble.  
You have to get back to the steering wheel to stabilize it.
