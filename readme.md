## Main gameplay

Various creatures will approach the steering wheel and try to break it.  
The steering wheel has a life meter that goes down when it is attacked.  
You have to grab the creatures and yeet them off the boat.  
If you stay away from the steering wheel for too long, the boat starts to wobble.  
You have to get back to the steering wheel to stabilize it.  

##Creatures

The creatures will be generated using various body parts (head, torso, limbs, and hands/feet).
Each body part affects different attributes.
- **Head:** Movement/behaviour
- **Torso:** How far they can be thrown
- **Limbs:** How fast they move
- **Hands/Feet:** How much damage they make to the steering wheel
